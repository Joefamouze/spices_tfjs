# spices
A deeplearning model that can run on the browser
The aim of this project is to train the computer to recognize images. 
The re are a lot of african spices and herbs which are not easy to come by, most times because we do not know the names of these spices and herbs.
I am building this browser based model to recognize a wide variety of spices and herbs, such that when an image is shown to the webcam, it can tell the general name of 
the spice or herb.
The success of this project will depend on how many different spices and herbs we can train it with. So please, a spice per contributor will go a long way.
